# Installation

:::warning[IMPORTANT]
**Migrating from v1:** All previous configuration will be backed up and unused. Configuration of compositor settings such as monitors, keybinds, and autostart is now up to you, as the project migrated from being dotfiles to being a shell.
:::

Wayshell installs through an automated script on Arch Linux, Fedora, Void Linux, and their derivatives. The script detects your distribution and uses the matching package manager (`pacman`, `dnf`, or `xbps`). On NixOS, use the [flake and modules](/installation/nixos) instead.

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mora1ss/wayshell/main/install/install.sh)"
```

:::info[NOTE]
To update, run the installer script again and choose **Update**.
:::

## Fedora

Fedora and its derivatives, such as **Nobara** and **Ultramarine**, are installed with `dnf`. Fedora does not package `gpu-screen-recorder`, so screen recording is unavailable there. SDDM is set up with its Wayland greeter, since Fedora ships no Xorg server.

## Void Linux

Void Linux, both glibc and musl, is installed with `xbps`. Everything comes from the official repositories except:

- **Hyprland**, which Void does not package. When you select it, the installer adds the third-party [black-hole.dev](https://mirror.black-hole.dev) repository in `/etc/xbps.d/20-wayshell-hyprland.conf` and accepts its signing key. Niri, Sway, and Mango come from the official repositories.
- **adw-gtk3** and **JetBrains Mono**, which are downloaded from their latest GitHub releases into `/usr/share/themes` and `/usr/share/fonts`.

Services are enabled through runit. `dbus`, `bluetoothd`, and `power-profiles-daemon` start right away. `NetworkManager` and `sddm` start from the next boot, so the installer does not cut your network or take over the screen while it runs. If `dhcpcd` or `wpa_supplicant` were enabled, they are kept from starting at the next boot, since they conflict with NetworkManager. Wi-Fi networks must then be connected again through Wayshell or `nmcli`. Display managers being replaced keep running until you reboot.

PipeWire is configured system-wide to launch WirePlumber and `pipewire-pulse`, with ALSA routed through it. Sessions started from SDDM get a D-Bus session bus and PipeWire automatically. If you start your compositor from a TTY instead, launch it with `dbus-run-session` and start `pipewire` from its autostart.

## Arch Linux and derivatives

Arch Linux and its derivatives (EndeavourOS, Manjaro, CachyOS, Garuda, Artix and others) are supported on systemd, OpenRC and other init systems.

## Build from source on Arch

Arch-based distributions can build Wayshell as a native package from this repository instead of running the installer script. The package installs the shell system-wide and pulls in every runtime dependency the installer would. The parts of the installer that change your home directory, services, or login screen are not done by a package, so you run them yourself afterwards.

The repository contains two PKGBUILDs in `packaging/aur`, and they conflict with each other:

| Package | Builds |
| --- | --- |
| `wayshell` | The latest tagged release |
| `wayshell-git` | The latest commit on `master` |

Install the build tools:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
```

Then clone the repository and build the package:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mora1ss/wayshell.git
cd wayshell/packaging/aur/wayshell
makepkg -si
```

For the latest commit instead of the latest release, use `cd wayshell/packaging/aur/wayshell-git`. `makepkg -si` installs the remaining dependencies with `pacman`, builds the package, and installs it.

:::warning[IMPORTANT]
Do not run the installer script on a system where Wayshell is installed this way. It would place a second copy in `~/.local/share/wayshell` and link it over the packaged one. Update by rebuilding the package, as described below, and use the steps that follow for anything the installer would otherwise do. If the in-app update notification offers to run the installer, ignore it.

The installer does not send telemetry, and a package install does not either.

### Manual setup

The packaged files live in `/usr/share/wayshell`. These steps copy what you need into your home directory and are written to be pasted into a shell one after another, since later steps reuse variables from earlier ones.

```bash
share=/usr/share/wayshell
cfg="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"
```

#### 1. Compositor config

Install the compositors you want, for example `sudo pacman -S hyprland`. The package lists Hyprland, Niri, Sway, and Mango as optional dependencies. Then copy the matching config. Choose one row:

| Compositor | `comp` | `dir` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hyprland | `hyprland` | `hypr` |
| Niri | `niri` | `niri` |
| Sway | `sway` | `sway` |
| Mango | `mango` | `mango` |

```bash
comp=hyprland
dir=hypr

if [ -d "$cfg/$dir" ]; then
    backup="$cfg/${dir}_backup/backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
    mkdir -p "$backup"
    cp -a "$cfg/$dir/." "$backup/"
fi
mkdir -p "$cfg/$dir"
cp -r "$share/compositors/$comp/." "$cfg/$dir/"
```

Your existing config is backed up first. Files with the same name in the new config replace yours, so move any personal settings back from the backup afterwards.

#### 2. Kitty, Cava, and Fastfetch configs

```bash
for app in kitty cava fastfetch; do
    mkdir -p "$cfg/$app"
    cp -r "$share/config/$app/." "$cfg/$app/"
done
```

This replaces files with the same name. Skip any app whose config you want to keep.

#### 3. Wallpapers

```bash
pictures="$(xdg-user-dir PICTURES 2>/dev/null)"
if [ -z "$pictures" ] || [ "$pictures" = "$HOME" ]; then
    pictures="$HOME/Pictures"
fi
wallpapers="$pictures/Wallpapers"
repo="${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/wayshell-wallpapers"

mkdir -p "$wallpapers"
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mora1ss/shell-wallpapers.git "$repo"
find "$repo" -path "$repo/.git" -prune -o -type f \
    \( -iname '*.jpg' -o -iname '*.jpeg' -o -iname '*.png' -o -iname '*.gif' -o -iname '*.webp' \) \
    -exec cp -t "$wallpapers" {} +
```

This is the full wallpaper pack. To keep only a few, copy those files out of `$repo` instead of running the last command.

#### 4. Wayshell settings

This merges the default settings with any settings you already have, keeps your values, and points the shell at your wallpaper folder:

```bash
settings="$cfg/wayshell/settings.json"
mkdir -p "$cfg/wayshell"
[ -s "$settings" ] || echo '{}' > "$settings"

jq -s --arg wp "$wallpapers" '(.[0] * .[1]) * {wallpaperDir: $wp}' \
    "$share/config/wayshell/settings.json" "$settings" > "$settings.tmp" \
    && mv "$settings.tmp" "$settings"

bash "$share/src/scripts/location.sh" --refresh
```

The last command detects your location for the weather widget. Skip it if you prefer to set the location by hand.

#### 5. Services

On systemd, enable the audio stack, networking, and power profiles:

```bash
sudo systemctl --global enable pipewire wireplumber pipewire-pulse
systemctl --user enable --now pipewire wireplumber pipewire-pulse
sudo systemctl enable --now NetworkManager power-profiles-daemon
```

On OpenRC, dinit, runit, or s6, enable `NetworkManager` and `power-profiles-daemon` with your init system's tools, and make sure PipeWire and WirePlumber start with your session.

#### 6. Qt icon theme

```bash
for qt in qt6ct; do
    mkdir -p "$cfg/$qt"
    [ -f "$cfg/$qt/$qt.conf" ] || printf '[Appearance]\nicon_theme=Adwaita\n' > "$cfg/$qt/$qt.conf"
done

if [ -z "$QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME" ] && ! grep -rqs '^QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=' "$cfg/environment.d"; then
    mkdir -p "$cfg/environment.d"
    printf 'QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct\n' > "$cfg/environment.d/wayshell-qt.conf"
fi
```

If you already have a `qt6ct.conf`, set `icon_theme=Adwaita` under `[Appearance]` yourself. Log out and back in for the environment variable to apply.

#### 7. SDDM login screen (optional)

The theme files are already installed. Install SDDM and its Qt dependencies, then configure it:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed sddm qt6-declarative qt6-svg

[ -f /etc/sddm.conf ] && sudo mv /etc/sddm.conf "/etc/sddm.conf.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"

sudo mkdir -p /etc/sddm.conf.d
sudo tee /etc/sddm.conf.d/10-material-you.conf > /dev/null <<'CONF'
[Theme]
Current=material-you
ThemeDir=/usr/share/sddm/themes

[General]
InputMethod=
CONF
```

`/etc/sddm.conf` overrides the files in `/etc/sddm.conf.d`, so it is moved aside. To run the greeter on Wayland, add these two lines under `[General]`:

```ini
DisplayServer=wayland
GreeterEnvironment=QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION=1
```

If another display manager is enabled, disable it before enabling SDDM, for example `sudo systemctl disable gdm`. Then enable SDDM:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable sddm.service
```

#### 8. First launch

Show the welcome guide on the next start:

```bash
rm -f "${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/wayshell/first_launch.done"
```

Log in to your compositor. The configs from step 1 start Wayshell on login. If you kept your own compositor config, add `wayshelld start` to its autostart.

### Updating and removing

To update, pull the repository and build again. The new package replaces the installed one:

```bash
cd wayshell
git pull
cd packaging/aur/wayshell
makepkg -si
```

Removing the package leaves everything in your home directory alone:

```bash
sudo pacman -Rns wayshell
```

Delete `~/.config/wayshell`, `~/.local/state/wayshell`, and `~/.cache/wayshell` yourself if you also want your settings gone.
